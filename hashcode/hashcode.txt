hashcode
Instructions
Write a function called HashCode() that takes a string as an argument and returns a new hashed string.

The hash equation is computed as follows:
(ASCII of current character + size of the string) % 127, ensuring the result falls within the ASCII range of 0 to 127.

If the resulting character is unprintable add 33 to it.
Expected function
func HashCode(dec string) string {
}
Usage
Here is a possible program to test your function:

package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Println(HashCode("A"))
	fmt.Println(HashCode("AB"))
	fmt.Println(HashCode("BAC"))
	fmt.Println(HashCode("Hello World"))
}
And its output:

$ go run .
B
CD
